                <h2>About Myself</h2>
                <p>My name is Gerald Danuco, a 24 year old IT student born on November 19, 2000. 
                    I live in D-1 Kinabjangan, Nasipit, Agusan del Norte. Passionate about cinematography, 
                    I love exploring the art of visual storytelling, capturing emotions through the lens, 
                    and experimenting with creative techniques. My goal is to use my skills to craft 
                    impactful narratives that resonate with audiences while continuously learning and growing 
                    in the world of filmmaking.</p>

                <h2>My Lifestory</h2>
                <p>My life when I was a kid is simple, spend time with my siblings, hang out with my friends and cheerful to other people 
                    and being curios about something that i didn’t encounter when I was a little kid. Sometimes, I wish I could go back to what
                    my life was when I was a kid. Being productive and energetic, a life without stress and freewill was a blissful to me.
                </p>

             <p>Then being a Teenager makes a life more challenging to me, 
                Because being a teenager is a whirlwind of emotions, self-discovery, and growth. 
                It’s a time of balancing school, friendships, hobbies,and dreams while 
                navigating the challenges of finding your identity. 
                Teen life is filled with unforgettable moments—late-night talks, first experiences,
                 and the joy of small victories. It’s about learning from mistakes, 
                embracing change, and figuring out who you are and who you want to be in a world that’s constantly evolving </p>

                <p>As a child, my love for creativity and curiosity blossomed into a passion for cinematography and thrifting.
                     I spent hours experimenting with camera apps in phone, capturing everyday moments, and turning them into stories. 
                     Thrifting became an adventure of its own—uncovering hidden treasures and finding beauty in the unexpected. 
                     These hobbies nurtured my imagination and taught me to see the world from unique 
                    perspectives, laying the foundation for my journey into visual storytelling and artistic expression.</p>

                <p> Videography and photography have always been my creative escape. 
                    Having my phone camera or sometimes i borrrow my sister's camera,
                    explore my surroundings, and capture the world through my lens, using visuals to express whatever 
                    I was feeling. Over time, it became more than just a hobby—it became a way to connect with myself and tell stories
                    that mattered to me. Though I didn’t share every project, videography and photography became my personal sanctuary, 
                    where I could truly be myself and lose myself in the art of visual storytelling.</p>

            <section>
                <p>One of my favorite ways to spend time is hanging out with friends and going thrifting together. Every weekend, 
                    we explore thrift stores, hunting for unique finds and hidden gems. 
                    I love the excitement of discovering something unexpected—the stories behind each item and the 
                    laughter we share while trying on quirky outfits. It’s a fun and creative way to bond, and each outing feels like an adventure,
                    filled with memories and treasures that make the experience so rewarding.

                    <h2>Favorites</h2>
                    <p>My favorite activities are watching cinematography tutorials and thrifting. 
                        I love immersing myself in tutorials that teach the art of visual storytelling,
                        exploring techniques for framing, lighting, and editing to bring stories to life. 
                        Thrifting, on the other hand, is my creative escape—searching for hidden treasures 
                        and unique pieces that inspire new ideas. Both activities fuel my passion for creativity, 
                        allowing me to learn, grow, and find inspiration in unexpected places.</p>

                <p>My favorite food is pares, a beloved Filipino dish known for its rich and savory flavors. 
                    It’s made with tender beef braised in a flavorful soy-based sauce, infused with garlic, star anise, and other aromatic spices.
                    Pares is often served with garlic fried rice and a side of beef broth, making it a comforting and satisfying meal. 
                    The perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors makes it my go-to dish whenever I crave something hearty and delicious.</p>

                <h2>Friends</h2>
                <p>My childhood friends is my core memory to me til this day, they are my inspiration and
                    they keep me company when there are times that I am down. Life without them are boring
                    because they just like my second siblings to me. Having a friends like them are so rare 
                    to me and I will cherish them until we successfully graduated in college soon.
